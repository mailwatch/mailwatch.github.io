üö® **Important Notice ‚Äì Migration to DBD::MariaDB & Perl module updates** üö®

This release introduces critical changes that require **manual actions**:

1. The MailScanner Perl scripts have been migrated from **DBD::mysql** to **DBD::MariaDB**.
    - You must ensure the Perl module `DBD::MariaDB` is installed.
    - `DBD::mysql` can remain installed ‚Äî removal is **not** required. What matters is that MailWatch is able to connect using `DBD::MariaDB`.
    - Please verify your MailScanner environment can connect to the database via `DBD::MariaDB` before upgrading in production.

2. You must copy the updated `.pm` (Perl module) files to the correct locations as described in the [INSTALL instructions](https://github.com/mailwatch/MailWatch/blob/1.2/MailScanner_perl_scripts/INSTALL).
    - Follow the documented paths carefully to avoid missing or broken modules.
    - If the `.pm` files are not placed correctly, the new Perl scripts will not function as expected.

‚ö†Ô∏è Without completing these steps, MailWatch **will not work properly**. Please plan the upgrade accordingly.
